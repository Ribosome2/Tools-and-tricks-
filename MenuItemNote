Unity MenuItem

Special Paths
As seen, the path passed to the MenuItem attribute controls under which top level menu the new item will be placed.

Unity has a few “special” paths that act as context menus (menus that are accessible using right-click):

Assets – items will be available under the “Assets” menu, as well using right-click inside the project view.

Assets/Create – items will be listed when clicking on the “Create” button in the project view (useful when adding new types that can be added to the project)

CONTEXT/ComponentName – items will be available by right-clicking inside the inspector of the given component.
